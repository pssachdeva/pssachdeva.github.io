                DataKind is an organization that brings together non-profit
                organizations and skilled volunteers to push forward data-related
                work for social impact. During 2020, I served on a DataCorps
                project with MedicMobile examining how predictive models
                could strengthen frontline community health workers in Kenya.

            RPR is a peer-led sexual harassment and assault workshop for first
            year graduate students. Originating in the Physics and Astronomy departments,
            we've since expanded to a variety of other departments at UC Berkeley.
            If you're interested in establishing an RPR workshop in your
            department, feel free to reach out!
