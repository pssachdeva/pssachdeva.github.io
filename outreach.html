                <b>Delta Analytics</b> <br>
                Delta Analytics connects Bay Area non-profits to local data
                professionals in order to facilitate the usage of data toward
                their missions. I served as a Data Fellow in 2020, working with
                a team to support <i>Tarjimly</i>. Tarjimly provides a platform
                capable of matching bilingual volunteers to displaced persons or
                aid workers in need of translating services. We developed a
                lightweight and scalable machine learning algorithm that provides
                the matching service for Tarjimly's app. We presented our work
                at the 2020 Machine Learning for the Developing
                World NeurIPS Workshop.

                <b>DataKind</b> <br>
                DataKind is an organization that brings together non-profit
                organizations and skilled volunteers to push forward data-related
                work for social impact. During 2020, I served on a DataCorps
                project with MedicMobile examining how predictive models
                could strengthen frontline community health workers in Kenya.

            <br>
            RPR is a peer-led sexual harassment and assault workshop for first
            year graduate students. Originating in the Physics and Astronomy departments,
            we've since expanded to a variety of other departments at UC Berkeley.
            If you're interested in establishing an RPR workshop in your
            department, feel free to reach out!

                <b>OpenOakland</b> 
                <br>
                OpenOakland is a Code for America Brigade. I helped Oakland
                Tech Exchange, an organization aimed at bridging the digital
                divide, perform data analysis that informed their understanding
                of the divide in the Bay Area.
