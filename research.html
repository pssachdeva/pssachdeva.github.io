	Neutron stars are among the most dense objects in the universe. But there are hypotheses that even denser objects could exist: hybrid stars. These stars are so dense that the neutrons in their core have broken down, forming a soup of strange quarks. <br><br>

	Physical systems typically like being in equilibrium. If we mess with that equilibrium - perturb it slightly - the system will strive to restore itself back to the equilibrium state. This manifests as oscillations, much like a pendulum will oscillate when you tap it. The same is true for stars, even those as dense as hybrid stars: they'll undergo a variety of oscillations when they're perturbed. <br><br>

	But sometimes, things go wrong. In the right circumstances, a perturbation might cause the system to lose control. In the case of hybrid stars, these perturbations could cause them to collapse into black holes. Such stars are considered <i>unstable.</i> <br> <br>

	In this project, we analyzed the stability of these theoretical hybrid stars. We showed that a certain class of hybrid stars previously thought to be stable are actually unstable, and therefore doomed to collapse into black holes. <br><br>

	This work was done in collaboration with Steven Harris and Mark Alford at Washington University.
