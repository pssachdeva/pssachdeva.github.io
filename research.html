            tl;dr: We showed that certain stars, previously thought to be stable,
            are actually unstable. <a class="readmore">[read more]</a>

        Neutron stars are among the most dense objects in the universe. But there
        are hypotheses that even denser objects could exist: hybrid stars. These
        stars are so dense that the neutrons in their core have broken down,
        forming a soup of strange quarks. <br><br>

        Physical systems typically like being in equilibrium. If we mess with that
        equilibrium - perturb it slightly - the system will strive to restore
        itself back to the equilibrium state. This manifests as oscillations, much
        like a pendulum will oscillate when you tap it. The same is true for stars,
        even those as dense as hybrid stars: they'll undergo a variety of
        oscillations when they're perturbed. <br><br>

        But sometimes, things go wrong. In the right circumstances, a perturbation
        might cause the system to lose control. In the case of hybrid stars, these
        perturbations could cause them to collapse into black holes. Such stars are
        considered <i>unstable.</i> <br> <br>

        In this project, we analyzed the stability of these theoretical hybrid
        stars. We showed that a certain class of hybrid stars previously thought to
        be stable are actually unstable, and therefore doomed to collapse into
        black holes. <br>
