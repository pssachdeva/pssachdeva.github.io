    Neutron stars are among the most dense objects in the universe. But there
    are hypotheses that even denser objects could exist: hybrid stars. These
    stars are so dense that the neutrons in their core have broken down,
    forming a soup of strange quarks. <br><br>

    Physical systems typically like being in equilibrium. If we mess with that
    equilibrium - perturb it slightly - the system will strive to restore
    itself back to the equilibrium state. This manifests as oscillations, much
    like a pendulum will oscillate when you tap it. The same is true for stars,
    even those as dense as hybrid stars: they'll undergo a variety of
    oscillations when they're perturbed. <br><br>

    But sometimes, things go wrong. In the right circumstances, a perturbation
    might cause the system to lose control. In the case of hybrid stars, these
    perturbations could cause them to collapse into black holes. Such stars are
    considered <i>unstable.</i> <br> <br>

    In this project, we analyzed the stability of these theoretical hybrid
    stars. We showed that a certain class of hybrid stars previously thought to
    be stable are actually unstable, and therefore doomed to collapse into
    black holes. <br><br>
