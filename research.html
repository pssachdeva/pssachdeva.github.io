	Neutron stars are among the most dense objects in the universe. But there are hypotheses that even denser objects could exist: strange stars. These stars <br>

	Physical systems typically strive to achieve a state of equilibrium. If we mess with that equilibrium - perturb it slightly - then the system will strive to restore itself back to the equilibrium state. This manifests as oscillations, much like a stretched rubber band will oscillate when you pull it. The same is true for stars, even those as dense as hybrid stars: they'll undergo a variety of oscillations when they're perturbed. <br>

	This work was done in collaboration with Steven Harris and Mark Alford at Washington University.
