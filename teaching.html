Here, I provide all of the teaching materials I've created. I'd like these resources to be publicly and freely available. If you find my teaching materials on a site that requires any form of payment (monetary or otherwise), please shoot me an email. <br><br>

	<h3><b>Physics 112:</b> Introduction to Statistical and Thermal Physics  <br></h3>
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15mSDxXHEadNdlMN0TJ1Awrd7WcnTly4F">[All Materials]</a> These materials were created in Fall 2016 for <a href="http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/qiu/teaching/112/112.htm">Professor Zi Qiu's class</a>. They include:
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xe0Qe_fIMmKAWRMVNlAvtFbTIf6AQPUN">[Discussion Section]</a> Problems and solutions that I wrote for the weekly discussion section. The topics roughly follow development of the material as treated by Kittel and Kroemer.</li>
			<li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G88lJK6joX_4qdsSzqeFUy2GPnCJzlcC">[Notes]</a> Lecture notes on probability distributions and the Ising model.</li>
			<li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=107tZ1GF-BpqX46YCrUKx58Hm5P3pfpPQ">[Code]</a> Code to draw Monte Carlo samples of spin distributions for the 2-D Ising model.</li>
