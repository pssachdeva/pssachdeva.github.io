Here, I provide all of the teaching materials I've created. I'd like these resources to be publicly and freely available. If you find my teaching materials on a site that requires any form of payment (monetary or otherwise), please shoot me an email.

		These materials were created in Spring 2017 for Professor Dan McKinsey's class with my co-GSI, Niladri Chatterji. Niladri and I split up the development of these materials equally. I've provided my half of the teaching materials, including:
		<ul>
			<li> Problems and solutions used in our discussion sections, which largely came from Griffiths (the solutions manual for which is easily found online).</li>
			<li> The weekly problem sets and solutions.</li>
		</ul>

		These materials were created in Fall 2016 for <a href="http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/qiu/teaching/112/112.htm">Professor Zi Qiu's class</a>. They include:
		<ul>
			<li>  Problems and solutions that I wrote for the weekly discussion section. The topics roughly follow the development of the material as treated by Kittel and Kroemer.</li>
			<li>  Lecture notes on probability distributions and the Ising model.</li>
			<li> Code to draw Monte Carlo samples of spin distributions for the 2-D Ising model.</li>
		</ul>
