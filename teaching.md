All teaching materials I've created during graduate school are provided on this page. I'd like these resources to be publicly and freely available. If you find my teaching materials on a site that requires any form of payment (monetary or otherwise), please shoot me an email.

## Physics 110A: Electromagnetism and Optics

| [All Materials](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rtvsFpM3twufnCvlNYFmglz-pverMLVW) | [Discussion Section](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FtAHNWSXQJDfGZy1mDhyawHLuSB02fv7) | [Problem Sets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xQawwDWOVgO___jegoaCQObAE4IHWQNL) |

These materials were created in Spring 2017 for Professor Dan McKinsey's class with my co-GSI, Niladri Chatterji. Niladri and I split up the development of these materials equally. I've only provided my half of the teaching materials, which is why some weeks or problem sets are not listed.

The materials include:
- Problems and solutions used in our discussion sections, which largely came from Griffiths (the solutions manual for which is easily found online).
- The weekly problem sets and solutions.

## Physics 112: Introduction to Statistical and Thermal Physics

| [All Materials](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15mSDxXHEadNdlMN0TJ1Awrd7WcnTly4F) | [Discussion Section](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xe0Qe_fIMmKAWRMVNlAvtFbTIf6AQPUN) | [Notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G88lJK6joX_4qdsSzqeFUy2GPnCJzlcC) | [Code](https://drive.google.com/open?id=107tZ1GF-BpqX46YCrUKx58Hm5P3pfpPQ) |

These materials were created in Fall 2016 for [Professor Zi Qiu's class](http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/qiu/teaching/112/112.htm). They include:
- Problems and solutions that I wrote for the weekly discussion section. The topics roughly follow the development of the material as treated by Kittel and Kroemer.
- Lecture notes on probability distributions and the Ising model.
- Code to draw Monte Carlo samples of spin distributions for the 2-D Ising model.

## Physics 7B: Physics for Scientists and Engineers

| [Lesson Plans FL15](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UNQY-MoEsHu8utPGjqcALnaO9S26rLrs) | [Worksheets FL15](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15lu0tYjJ29kMSQnDGecaeHw_3ZNkWa8c) | [Lesson Plans SP16](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KdiHtbg9Hn4u5cMqg38fc7OQaxWqvfDs) | [Worksheets SP16](https://drive.google.com/open?id=180O_xkz9QuUSn1S1JsYpbx_6cHWANikw) |

I taught Physics 7B in both Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. I've included materials relevant for students both taking and teaching the class. They include:
- Worksheets that I provided to my students in each discussion section. Most worksheets include problems that I felt were important for the class, some of which I solved during the discussion section. Some "challenge problems" are also included. Other worksheets served more as lecture notes. Unfortunately, no solutions are provided (but some answers are).
- Lessons plans that I used as reference to help steer the course of the discussion section. These may be of interest to GSIs who are deciding how to structure their sections.
