I am a Research Scientist in the [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on the societal impacts of machine learning models, with an emphasis on understanding the norms and values elicited from large language models. I also lead and support a range of social science projects, spanning hate speech detection, education, and computational humanities.

I previously obtained my PhD in the Physics Department at UC Berkeley, conducting research in the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/) under [Kristofer Bouchard](http://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) and [Mike DeWeese](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/michael-deweese). My graduate research focused on neural variability: its structure, implications for neural coding, and impacts on phenomenological models of neural activity. My graduate work was funded by the Department of Defense through the NDSEG Fellowship.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics and Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis, where I studied the stability of hybrid stars under [Mark Alford](https://physics.wustl.edu/people/mark-g-alford). 

Iâ€™ve also worked at the intersection of data science and public interest, applying machine learning in mission-driven contexts. I've completed a [DataCorps project with DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/datacorps), a [Data Fellowship with Delta Analytics](https://deltanalytics.org/), and a [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) at the University of Washington.
