<h3>In Brief:</h3> 
<ul>
<li><b>Stop-and-frisk</b> is a controversial policing tactic where police officers
stop and detain residents in an effort to recover drugs, weapons, and contraband.</li>
<li>The majority of stop-and-frisks performed on New York City residents
who are suspected of carrying a weapon actually have a <b>low probability of
producing a weapon</b>, given the features that officers knew prior to the stop.</li>
<li>Controlling for the location of the stop, <b>stop-and-frisks
exhibit racial disparities</b> in their probabilities of turning up a weapon.</li>
<li> The authors contextualize these results in the cases of
the <b>Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</b></li>
