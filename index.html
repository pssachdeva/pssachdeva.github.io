<p> I'm a graduate student in the physics department at UC Berkeley. I work in the <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a> under <a href="http://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/">Kristofer Bouchard</a> and Mike DeWeese. My research is funded by the Department of Defense through the <a href="http://www.ndsegfellowships.org/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests focus largely on neural variability: its structure, implications for neural coding, and impacts on phenomenological models of neural activity.</p>

<p>I'm deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. When I'm not doing research, I spend time thinking about how to solve and raise awareness for issues regarding racial and gender justice.</p>

<p>I also like running, hiking, <a href="https://medium.com/nbycreads">reading</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/the.nbyc/shop/?ref=page_internal">designing t-shirts</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIe6b3T6dcOrQ1qJJtiazEg">critiquing salsas</a>.
