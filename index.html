<p> I'm a graduate student in the physics department at UC Berkeley. I work in
  the <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center for Theoretical
    Neuroscience</a> under <a href="http://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/">Kristofer
      Bouchard</a> and Mike DeWeese. My research is funded by the Department
      of Defense through the <a href="http://www.ndsegfellowships.org/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests focus largely on neural variability: its structure,
  implications for neural coding, and impacts on phenomenological models of neural activity.
  I've also conducted research in the realm of leveraging data and machine learning toward
  policy and non-profit work. I've completed a <a href="https://www.datakind.org/datacorps">DataCorps project with DataKind</a>,
  a <a href="http://www.deltanalytics.org/fellows.html">Data Fellowship with Delta Analytics</a>,
  and a <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/">Data Science for Social Good Fellowship</a> at the University of Washington.
</p>

<p>I'm deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. When I'm not doing research, I spend time thinking about how to solve and raise awareness for issues regarding racial and gender justice.</p>

<p>I also like running, cycling, hiking, crosswords, and preparing large feasts.</p>
