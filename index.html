<p>
  I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu">D-Lab</a> at UC Berkeley.
  Previously, I obtained my PhD in the physics department at UC Berkeley, conducting research in
  the <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center for Theoretical
  Neuroscience</a> under <a href="http://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/">Kristofer
  Bouchard</a> and Mike DeWeese. My graduate research was funded by the Department
  of Defense through the <a href="http://www.ndsegfellowships.org/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My current research interests focus largely on applications of machine learning in society,
  with a focus on automated hate speech measurement. My graduate research focused on neural variability: its structure,
  implications for neural coding, and impacts on phenomenological models of neural activity. Prior to that, I conducted research in theoretical astrophysics on hybrid stars.

I've also worked in the realm of leveraging data and machine learning toward
policy and non-profit work. I've completed a <a href="https://www.datakind.org/datacorps">DataCorps project with DataKind</a>,
a <a href="http://www.deltanalytics.org/fellows.html">Data Fellowship with Delta Analytics</a>,
and a <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/">Data Science for Social Good Fellowship</a> at the University of Washington.
</p>

<p>I'm deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. When I'm not doing research, I spend time thinking about how to solve and raise awareness for issues regarding racial and gender justice.</p>

<p>I also enjoy cycling, running, backpacking, crosswords, and preparing large feasts.</p>
